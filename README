Karate Chop in C
================

This is my attempt at Dave Thomas's karate chop code kata:
  "Write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target and a sorted
  array of integers. It should return the integer index of the target in the
  array, or -1 if the target is not in the array."
See http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html

I chose to use C, and tried to stick to a pure TDD process, because I've
never really tried it before.


chop.c  -  the implementations
test.c  -  the tests and a main() function to drive them

At the bottom of chop.c you can use commenting to pick the implementation
you want.

I scattered notes as comments as I went along to try and capture my thinking.

It uses the "check" unit testing framework for C:
http://check.sourceforge.net/
To install under debian/ubuntu:
  $ sudo apt-get install check


During development, I'd run...
  $ watch make test

...in a separate window. This just builds and runs the tests continuously,
at 2 second intervals.
